\title{equate() Function}
\usage{
equate(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(Required) data.frame of N gates, containing columns for \code{gate}, \code{type}, and \code{set}. Outputted by \code{curate()}. Must have at least one row with \code{class == "top"} representing the top event.}
}
\value{
A character string containing the complete boolean equation for the entire fault tree. The equation:
\itemize{
\item Uses \code{*} (multiplication) to represent AND operations
\item Uses \code{+} (addition) to represent OR operations
\item Contains only basic event names (no gate references)
\item Is wrapped in parentheses to preserve order of operations
\item Represents the top event's boolean logic in terms of all basic events
}
This equation can be passed directly to \code{formulate()} to create an executable function.
}
\description{
This function extracts the equation for a fault tree from a \code{data.frame} of \code{gate}s and \code{set}s, outputted by \code{curate()}.
}
\details{
This function builds the complete boolean equation through an iterative substitution algorithm:
\itemize{
\item Starts with the top event's \code{set} expression, which may contain references to other gates
\item Iteratively replaces each gate name with its corresponding \code{set} boolean expression
\item Continues until no gate names remain in any expression (only basic events remain)
\item Returns the fully expanded equation from the top event (first row of the data.frame)
}
The algorithm processes gates in order and handles nested gate structures by repeatedly substituting until convergence. The substitution preserves the boolean operators (\code{*} for AND, \code{+} for OR) and parentheses structure created by \code{curate()}.
