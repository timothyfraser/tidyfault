\usage{
formulate(formula)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{(Required) A character string containing the boolean logic equation of a fault tree. Should use \code{*} for AND operations, \code{+} for OR operations, and parentheses for grouping. The equation should contain only basic event names (no gate references). Typically output from \code{equate()}.}
}
\value{
A function object that:
\itemize{
\item Accepts named arguments for each basic event in the formula
\item Each argument accepts numeric values (typically 0 or 1 for binary events)
\item Returns a numeric value representing the system state (typically 0 for no failure, >= 1 for failure)
\item Evaluates the boolean equation using R's arithmetic operators (\code{*} for AND, \code{+} for OR)
}
The function can be called directly with event values or passed to \code{calculate()} to generate a complete truth table.
}
\description{
This function \emph{formulates} a \code{function} that can compute probabilities of system failure. To do so, it converts a character string describing the boolean equation of a fault tree into a \code{function} that can compute probabilities of system failure into that function. Handles AND and OR operations.
}
\details{
This function converts a boolean equation string into an executable R function through the following process:
\itemize{
\item Extracts all unique event names from the formula by splitting on operators (\code{+}, \code{*}, \code{(}, \verb{)})
\item Creates formal arguments for the function, one for each unique event name
\item Sets the function body to parse and evaluate the formula string
\item Returns a function that can be called with named arguments for each event
}
The function uses R's arithmetic operators where multiplication (\code{*}) represents AND logic and addition (\code{+}) represents OR logic. When called with binary inputs (0/1), the function returns 0 for no failure and a positive value for failure. The function preserves the order of operations through parentheses in the original formula.
