\title{tabulate() Function}
\usage{
tabulate(data, formula, method = "mocus")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(Required) Output from \code{concentrate()} function. For \code{method = "mocus"}, expects a character vector of minimum cutset expressions (e.g., \code{"A * B"}). For \code{method = "CCubes"}, expects a QCA solution object from \code{concentrate()} with \code{method = "CCubes"}.}

\item{formula}{(Required) Function output from \code{formulate()}. Used to generate the truth table for calculating coverage statistics when \code{method = "mocus"}. Not used when \code{method = "CCubes"}.}

\item{method}{(Optional) Character string specifying the method used. Default is \code{"mocus"}, which works with character vector output from \code{concentrate(method = "mocus")}. Alternatively, \code{"CCubes"} works with QCA solution objects from \code{concentrate(method = "CCubes")}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} (tibble) with one row per minimum cutset, containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{mincut}: Character string representing the minimum cutset as a boolean expression (e.g., \code{"A * B"} for events A AND B)
\item \code{query}: Character string containing a filter expression that can be used to identify truth table rows matching this cutset (e.g., \code{"filter(A == 1, B == 1, outcome == 1)"})
\item \code{cutsets}: Integer count of truth table rows (cutsets) that match this minimum cutset and result in system failure
\item \code{failures}: Integer count of total truth table rows that result in system failure (same for all rows)
\item \code{coverage}: Numeric value (0 to 1) representing the proportion of failure cases covered by this minimum cutset. Calculated as \code{cutsets / failures}. Higher coverage indicates a more critical failure path.
}
Rows are grouped by \code{mincut}, allowing easy identification of the most critical failure paths based on coverage.
}
\description{
This function \emph{tabulates} a \code{data.frame} of \code{N} minimum cutsets in your fault tree, describing each \code{mincut} set, a \code{query} used to filter a table of all sets, the number of \code{cutsets} that include that \code{mincut}, the total number of cutsets leading to \code{failure}, and the \code{coverage} (percentage of \code{cutsets} covered out of total failures) for that \code{mincut}.
}
\details{
This function analyzes minimum cutsets to quantify their importance in system failure:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Truth Table Generation}: For \code{method = "mocus"}, uses \code{formula} to generate a complete truth table via \code{calculate()}. For \code{method = "CCubes"}, extracts the truth table from the QCA solution object.
\item \strong{Cutset Parsing}: Splits each minimum cutset expression into individual events and determines their required states (1 for occurrence, 0 for non-occurrence, indicated by tilde \code{~} in QCA format)
\item \strong{Query Construction}: Creates filter expressions that identify truth table rows matching each cutset's event combination
\item \strong{Coverage Calculation}: Counts how many failure cases (rows with \code{outcome == 1}) are covered by each minimum cutset, then calculates coverage as a proportion
}
Coverage represents the explanatory power of each minimum cutset: a cutset with coverage = 0.5 means it explains 50\% of all system failure cases. This metric helps prioritize which failure paths are most critical for risk mitigation. The \code{query} column provides reusable filter expressions for further analysis.
