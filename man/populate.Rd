\title{populate() Function}
\usage{
populate(binary_outcomes, event_probs)
}
\arguments{
\item{binary_outcomes}{(Required) Data frame with binary (0/1) event states.
Must have one column per basic event (with event names as column names) and
optionally a \code{scenario} column. Each row represents one scenario.}

\item{event_probs}{(Required) Data frame with two columns: \code{event} (event names)
and \code{probability} (failure probabilities in \code{[0, 1]}). Must contain probabilities
for all events present in \code{binary_outcomes}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the same structure as \code{binary_outcomes}, where:
\itemize{
\item Values of 1 are replaced with P(event) from \code{event_probs}
\item Values of 0 remain as 0
}
The \code{scenario} column (if present) is preserved unchanged.
}
\description{
Converts binary outcomes (0/1) to probability outcomes by replacing 1s with
event failure probabilities. The output has the same structure as the input
binary outcomes, but with probabilities instead of binary values.
}
\details{
This function transforms binary event states by replacing occurrences
(1s) with their corresponding failure probabilities. For each event column,
if the binary value is 1 (event occurred), it is replaced with the failure
probability P(event) from \code{event_probs}. If the binary value is 0 (event did
not occur), it remains 0. This creates a data frame suitable for probabilistic
evaluation where only occurring events have probability values.

\examples{
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyfault)

data("db_outcomes_binary")
data("db_probs")

# Convert binary outcomes to probability outcomes
populate(db_outcomes_binary, db_probs)

# Compare: binary has 0/1, probability version has P(event) where binary was 1, 0 otherwise
db_outcomes_binary
populate(db_outcomes_binary, db_probs)
