\title{curate() Function}
\usage{
curate(nodes, edges)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{(Required) data.frame of N \code{nodes} (1 to N rows), with a unique \code{id} for each node, an \code{event} name describing the node (some events occur multiple times), and a \code{type} vector categorizing nodes as \code{"and"} | \code{"or"} gates, \code{"top"} nodes, or \code{"not"} a gate or top node (ie. a normal node)}

\item{edges}{(Required) data.frame of N \code{edges} (1 to N rows), showing ties between the \code{from} node's \code{id} to the \code{to} node's \code{id}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} (tibble) with one row per gate, containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{gate}: Character vector of gate/event names
\item \code{type}: Factor or character vector indicating gate type (\code{"top"}, \code{"and"}, or \code{"or"})
\item \code{class}: Factor with levels \code{"top"} and \code{"gate"}, classifying nodes as top events or intermediate gates
\item \code{n}: Integer count of events immediately connected to this gate
\item \code{set}: Character string containing the boolean expression for this gate's inputs, using \code{*} for AND operations and \code{+} for OR operations, wrapped in parentheses
\item \code{items}: List column containing character vectors of event names that are inputs to this gate
}
Rows are sorted with top events first, followed by gates in alphabetical order.
}
\description{
This function \emph{curates} a \code{data.frame} of N \code{gates} and the \code{sets} of events immediately linked to those gates.
}
\details{
This function performs the initial curation step in the fault tree analysis workflow:
\itemize{
\item Filters nodes to only gates and top events (excludes basic events with \code{type == "not"})
\item Joins edge information to identify which events connect to each gate
\item Converts gate relationships into boolean expressions: AND gates use \code{*} (multiplication), OR gates use \code{+} (addition)
\item Wraps each gate's set expression in parentheses to preserve order of operations
\item Creates both string (\code{set}) and list (\code{items}) representations of gate inputs for different downstream uses
}
The output serves as the foundation for subsequent steps: \code{equate()} uses the \code{set} column to build the complete boolean equation, while \code{mocus()} uses the \code{items} list column for cutset generation.
